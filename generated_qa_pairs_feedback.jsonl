1 content的最后一句话 The answer must include the number of audios in the output to support or illustrate the explanation. 
  意思是在问题中指出，应该要包含多少个音频来支持或说明答案。比如这里应该说 The answer mush include 4 audios in the output to support or 
  illustrate the explanation.
2 4o给response的时候，可以设置他输出format是json格式，然后多个json组成jsonl文件，这样的话每个case在jsonl就不是一行（一行的不方便看），是标准的多行的
  json格式
3 id在一个subdomain下是唯一且连续的
4 可以适当修改construction requirements中的内容，输出的哪里不满足要求，就额外加上要求
5 最后给出的jsonl文件里，modal部分的内容是相对路径，路径这一部分 "image/img_0601_01.png" 命名的规则在主文档里有写
6 需要给提交的两部分：数据文件（上传到公开github仓库）和jsonl（上传到私有仓库）
7 jsonl的上传：在每个domain下创建subdomain的文件夹，然后在下面对original data分别创建文件夹，然后在下面对每个interleaved format创建文件夹
  (这个文件夹的命名 文+视+音-> 文+图 命名为： video&audio_image），在下面上传jsonl文件
